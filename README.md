# Beginner-Programmes
This is a list of python programmes I've written in these beginner days of mine.
These programmes consist of programmes I wrote solely on my own and those I followed tutorials to write.
I did not copy and paste the codes of such tutorials. I follow and understand to my best knowledge and try to replicate what is being
done.
Please feel free to scrutinise my code for better functionality.
Thank you!
